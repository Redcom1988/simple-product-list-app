This is an app I made for an entrance test to an internship. This Kotlin Android application built with Jetpack Compose. It displays a list of products and allows users to view product details. The project uses Material3 components, navigation, and a simple MVVM pattern.

DISCLAIMER:
I previously made this without making a git repo, that's the reason why all the commits are so close to each other
